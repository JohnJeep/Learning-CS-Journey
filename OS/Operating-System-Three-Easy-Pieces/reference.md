- “Cooperating sequential processes” by Edsger W. Dijkstra. 1968. Available online here:http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd01xx/EWD123.PDF. One of the early seminal papers. Discusses how Dijkstra posed the original concurrency problem, and Dekker’s solution.

- “glibc 2.9 (include Linux pthreads implementation)” by Many authors.. Available here:http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc. In particular, take a look at the nptl subdirectory where you will find most of the pthread support in Linux today.

- “Information Streams Sharing a Finite Buffer” by E.W. Dijkstra. Information ProcessingLetters 1: 179180, 1972. Available: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd03xx/EWD329.PDF
The famous paper that introduced the producer/consumer problem.
- “My recollections of operating system design” by E.W. Dijkstra. April, 2001. Available: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd13xx/EWD1303.PDF. A fascinating read for those of you interested in how the pioneers of our field came up with some very basic and fundamental concepts, including ideas like “interrupts” and even “a stack”!
